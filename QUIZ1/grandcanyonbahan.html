	<figcaption>Located in Arizona, <b>Grand Canyon National Park</b>encompasses 277 miles(466 km) of the Colorado River and adjacent uplands. The park is home to much of the immense Grand Canyon; a mile (1.6 km) deep, and up to 18 miles (29 km) wide. Layered bands of colorful rock reveal millions of years of geologic history. Grand Canyon is <i>unmatched</i> in the vistas it offers visitors from the rim. Open 24 hours.</figcaption>
